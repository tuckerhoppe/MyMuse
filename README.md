## ‚ú® About The Project

My Muse is a SwiftUI application designed for writers of all levels who are looking for a simple, beautiful space to practice their craft. The core of the app is a new writing prompt delivered each day. Users can write and share their responses, read submissions from others, and track their creative journey on their personal profile.

This project was built from the ground up to demonstrate a full-stack iOS application using Apple's native frameworks. It showcases modern UI design, cloud data synchronization, and clean architectural patterns.

## üéØ Project Goals & Learning

This project was an exercise in building a complete, data-driven iOS application. Key learning objectives included:

* Mastering asynchronous data fetching and state management with CloudKit and Combine.
* Implementing a robust and reactive UI using modern SwiftUI patterns like `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@FocusState`.
* Designing and structuring a scalable and maintainable project architecture.
* Managing a project from initialization to deployment using Git for version control.
